    <p class="subtitle">ExpatHub by Magic Elf Digital &mdash; Last updated: February 12, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Magic Elf Digital ("we," "our," or "us") operates the ExpatHub mobile application. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our app. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>ExpatHub is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)</li>
      <li>Location data</li>
      <li>Contacts, photos, or media</li>
      <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
      <li>Usage analytics or behavioral tracking data</li>
      <li>Cookies or web tracking technologies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>ExpatHub stores a small amount of data locally on your device to improve your experience. This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Country preference:</strong> The country you select for browsing guides and resources.</li>
      <li><strong>App preferences:</strong> Display and navigation settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can clear this data at any time by uninstalling the app or clearing the app's storage in your device settings.</p>

    <h2>Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    <p>ExpatHub offers optional paid subscriptions ("ExpatHub Pro") to unlock premium content. All payment processing is handled entirely by third-party services:</p>

      <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> (subscription management platform)</li>
      <li><strong>Stripe</strong> (for web-based purchases, if applicable)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect, process, or store any payment information (credit card numbers, billing addresses, etc.). Your purchase history and subscription status are managed by the respective app store and RevenueCat. Please refer to their privacy policies for details on how they handle your payment data:</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app may contain links to external websites, such as official government immigration resources, community forums, or vendor services.

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect or transmit personal data, there is minimal risk to your information. Local preferences stored on your device are protected by your device's built-in security features (passcode, biometrics, encryption).</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
