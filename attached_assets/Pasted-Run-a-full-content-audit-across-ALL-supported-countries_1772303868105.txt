Run a full content audit across ALL supported countries in the repo.

Goal:
Validate every factual claim related to immigration pathways, visa rules, income thresholds, savings thresholds, documentation requirements, and process descriptions.

Scope:
ALL country data files and pathway definitions, including:
- Existing countries
- Germany
- Ireland
- Australia

Critical Rules:
- Do NOT browse the web.
- Do NOT invent citations.
- Use only URLs or references already present in the repository.
- If no in-repo source exists, mark as UNSOURCED.
- If a claim involves thresholds, numbers, dates, program names, or eligibility rules, mark as VOLATILE even if a link exists.

--------------------------------------------------
1️⃣ Build a Master Audit Table
--------------------------------------------------

Create a structured table with these columns:

Country
File Path
Field / Location
Claim (short excerpt)
Claim Type (Visa Rule / Threshold / Process / General Info / Documentation)
Source Found in Repo (exact URL or reference)
Source Type (Official / Authoritative / Community / None)
Status (SUPPORTED / UNSOURCED / VOLATILE)
Risk Level (Low / Medium / High)
Recommended Action (Keep / Soften / Add Source Placeholder / Remove Specific Number)

Do this for ALL countries, not just the new ones.

--------------------------------------------------
2️⃣ Source Badge Classification
--------------------------------------------------

For every resource link found:

Classify as:
- OFFICIAL (government immigration site, embassy, official ministry)
- AUTHORITATIVE (recognized institution, EU portal, national health service)
- COMMUNITY (blog, expat site, forum)
- NONE (no source present)

If no source exists for a claim:
Mark:
Source Type = NONE
Status = UNSOURCED

--------------------------------------------------
3️⃣ Volatility Detection Rules
--------------------------------------------------

Automatically flag as VOLATILE if the claim contains:
- Specific income numbers
- Specific savings numbers
- Exact processing times
- Named visa subclasses (e.g., 189, Blue Card, etc.)
- Salary thresholds
- Tax rules
- Health insurance requirements tied to regulation

Even if supported, mark VOLATILE to indicate likely change over time.

--------------------------------------------------
4️⃣ Rewrite Recommendations
--------------------------------------------------

For each HIGH or MEDIUM risk UNSOURCED or VOLATILE claim:
Provide a safer rewrite suggestion.

Rules for rewrite:
- Replace exact numbers with bracket-based phrasing
- Use "typically", "often", "based on published guidance"
- Add: "Requirements may change. Always verify with official sources."
- Never say "you qualify" or "guaranteed"

Do NOT modify code yet.
Only produce recommendations.

--------------------------------------------------
5️⃣ Final Output Structure
--------------------------------------------------

Output:

A) Summary by country:
   - Total claims
   - # Supported
   - # Unsourced
   - # Volatile
   - Top 3 highest-risk statements

B) Full Master Audit Table (structured and readable)

C) Priority Fix List:
   - Top 15 highest-risk items across all countries

This is a compliance and stability audit.
Do not refactor unrelated code.
Do not modify entitlements.
Do not change payment logic.
