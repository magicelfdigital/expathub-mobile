We are refactoring Explore so it is NOT a duplicate of Countries.

GUARDRAILS
- Do NOT change navigation layout files or tab config (no renaming tabs today).
- Do NOT change routing for Countries.
- Do NOT change subscription logic.
- Provide FULL FILE REPLACEMENTS ONLY.
- Ask for files ONE AT A TIME.

GOAL
Explore should help users who have NOT chosen a country yet by offering decision-based entry points.
Countries remains the full directory and hub entry.

EXPLORE V1 DESIGN
Replace Explore screen content with 4 “decision entry cards”:

A) Title: "I need to keep working"
   Subtitle: "Remote work rules vary. Start with visas that explicitly allow it and don’t quietly trap you later."
   Route to: /explore/remote-work

B) Title: "I want a local job (sponsorship)"
   Subtitle: "Most countries require employer sponsorship. Learn what’s realistic before you apply or relocate."
   Route to: /explore/sponsorship

C) Title: "I’m not sure yet — I want flexibility"
   Subtitle: "If you’re still deciding, choose a path that doesn’t block future options and buys time legally."
   Route to: /explore/flexibility

D) Title: "I care about long-term residency (PR)"
   Subtitle: "Some visas are dead ends. Start with options that align with PR pathways and work rights."
   Route to: /explore/pr

At the bottom of Explore, include a secondary link/button:
- "Browse all countries" -> /(tabs)/country

TOPIC SCREEN
Create a single reusable topic detail screen pattern: app/(tabs)/explore/[topic].tsx (or separate files if preferred).
Each topic screen should show:
- A short explainer paragraph (2–4 lines)
- A curated list of countries (from our 8 launch countries) relevant to the topic
- Each country row includes a badge: "Ready" vs "Coming soon"
- Tapping a country navigates to /(tabs)/country/[slug]
- No paywall, no ProGate here.

COUNTRY LIST + BADGES
Use existing data sources:
- Countries from src/data (preferred) or existing COUNTRIES array.
- Coverage badges must come from src/data/coverage.ts (if it exists). If not available, implement a minimal local map in the topic screen for now (but prefer coverage.ts).

IMPLEMENTATION ORDER
1) Ask me for the current Explore screen file (likely app/(tabs)/explore.tsx).
   Replace it fully with the new Explore cards UI.
2) Create the new topic screen file(s) and provide full contents.
3) If you need coverage.ts, ask for it (but do NOT change it today unless necessary for badges).

STOP after Explore is refactored and topic screens exist.
Summarize changes in 3 bullets.
