TASK: Add minimal, decision-focused analytics to understand user behavior
while expanding content for all 8 launch countries.

GOAL
Capture *decision intent*, not vanity metrics.
Answer:
- What content reduces hesitation?
- What do users check before paying?
- Where do they leave?

GUARDRAILS
- Do NOT change navigation, layout, or styling.
- Do NOT add heavy analytics SDKs.
- Use existing trackEvent utility if present.
- FULL FILE REPLACEMENTS ONLY.
- Ask for files ONE AT A TIME.

EVENTS TO ADD (ONLY THESE)

1) Explore
Event: explore_opened
Fire once when Explore screen mounts.

Event: compare_started
Fire when CompareMatrix is first rendered.

2) Compare Matrix
Event: compare_row_viewed
Payload:
- rowId
- countrySlugs[]

Fire the first time each row becomes visible (no need for perfect viewport detection; first render is OK).

3) Decision Briefs (Country + Pathway)
Event: decision_brief_opened
Payload:
- countrySlug
- pathwayKey? (if applicable)

Event: brief_section_viewed
Payload:
- countrySlug
- pathwayKey?
- sectionId ("family" | "culture" | "work" | "tax" | "timeline")

Fire when section header is expanded or scrolled into view.

4) Paywall
Event: paywall_viewed
Payload:
- context ("country" | "pathway" | "compare")
- countrySlug?
- pathwayKey?

Event: paywall_dismissed
Fire when user closes or navigates away.

Event: subscription_started
Fire when checkout flow begins (not completion).

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (MANDATORY ORDER)

A) Ask me where trackEvent lives
   (e.g. src/lib/analytics.ts)

B) Add events to:
   - app/(tabs)/explore.tsx
   - src/components/CompareMatrix.tsx
   - Decision Brief screen(s)
   - src/components/ProPaywall.tsx

C) Ensure events fire only once per session where appropriate
   (simple useRef guard is fine).

DO NOT:
- track scroll position continuously
- add user identifiers beyond existing setup
- block UI on analytics

OUTPUT
- List of files changed
- List of events implemented
- One paragraph: “What questions this answers”

STOP after instrumentation.
