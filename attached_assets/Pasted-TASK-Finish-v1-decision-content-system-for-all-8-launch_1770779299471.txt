TASK: Finish v1 decision content system for all 8 launch countries, with analytics and pricing signal.

CONTEXT
ExpatHub is launching v1 with 8 countries:
Portugal, Spain, Canada, Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador, Malta, UK.

We already have:
- Coverage / AvailabilityGate / ComingSoon wired
- ProGate + ProPaywall working
- CompareMatrix feature implemented
- DecisionBrief freshness metadata (Task A)
- Gating consistency verified

This task focuses on:
1) Expanding Decision Brief content (structured, scalable)
2) Adding minimal analytics to observe decision behavior
3) Using that data to pressure-test pricing (no pricing changes yet)

GUARDRAILS
- Do NOT change navigation, routing, or tab structure
- Do NOT change subscription providers or prices
- Do NOT add heavy analytics SDKs
- Use existing trackEvent utility
- FULL FILE REPLACEMENTS ONLY
- Ask for files ONE AT A TIME if they already exist
- No new dependencies

────────────────────────────
PHASE 1 — Decision Brief Content Expansion (All 8 Countries)
────────────────────────────

GOAL
Every launch country must have a credible “decision-closing” brief, not encyclopedic detail.

1) Extend DecisionBrief schema (if not already done)
Confirm DecisionBrief includes sections:
- overview
- workReality
- familyAndDependents
- lifestyleAndCulture
- commonMistakes
- whoThisIsNotFor

If schema already exists, do NOT change structure—only populate data.

2) Create a reusable content template
Create: src/data/decisionBriefTemplate.ts

Export function:
buildDecisionBrief({
  countrySlug,
  pathwayKey?
}) → DecisionBrief

Each brief must answer:
- Can I stay legally?
- Can I work, and how realistic is it?
- Can I bring my spouse/kids?
- What lifestyle/cultural friction surprises people?
- Who should NOT choose this country?

Tone:
- factual
- cautionary where needed
- no marketing language
- no promises

3) Populate briefs for ALL 8 countries
Create or update:
src/data/decisionBriefs.ts

Populate SHORT-FORM briefs for:
- Portugal
- Spain
- Canada
- Costa Rica
- Panama
- Ecuador
- Malta
- UK

Notes:
- Use “varies” or “depends” where appropriate
- It is OK to mark sections as “limited clarity” if true
- ConfidenceLevel may start at “medium”

STOP after all 8 briefs exist and are wired into existing screens.

────────────────────────────
PHASE 2 — Minimal Decision Analytics (High Signal Only)
────────────────────────────

GOAL
Understand what reduces uncertainty and triggers conversion.

EVENTS TO ADD (ONLY THESE)

Explore:
- explore_opened (on mount)
- compare_started (when CompareMatrix first renders)

CompareMatrix:
- compare_row_viewed
  payload: { rowId, countrySlugs }

Decision Briefs:
- decision_brief_opened
  payload: { countrySlug, pathwayKey? }

- brief_section_viewed
  payload: { countrySlug, pathwayKey?, sectionId }
  sectionId values:
    "work" | "family" | "culture" | "mistakes"

Paywall:
- paywall_viewed
  payload: { context, countrySlug?, pathwayKey? }
- subscription_started

IMPLEMENTATION ORDER
A) Ask me where trackEvent is defined
B) Instrument:
   - Explore screen
   - CompareMatrix component
   - Decision Brief screen(s)
   - ProPaywall component
C) Use simple “fire once per session” guards (useRef is fine)

DO NOT:
- track scroll continuously
- add user identifiers
- block UI on analytics
