TASK: Set up GitHub Actions automation (Option 2) to monitor sources and open PRs with detected changes/proposals.

CONTEXT
- ExpatHub repo uses JS/TS but we cannot assume ts-node/tsx exists.
- We will implement a dependency-free monitoring runner in Node (ESM .mjs) that:
  1) reads a curated list of URLs to monitor
  2) fetches each URL (no scraping libs)
  3) extracts basic text + computes SHA256 hash
  4) compares against saved previous hashes
  5) if any changes, writes:
     - monitoring/state.json (updated hashes)
     - monitoring/proposals.json (simple change entries with timestamps + default severity P2)
  6) GitHub Action opens a PR with these files updated

GUARDRAILS
- Do NOT change navigation, UI, paywall, or app runtime code.
- Do NOT add new dependencies.
- FULL FILE REPLACEMENTS ONLY.
- Ask for files ONE AT A TIME only if they already exist and must be edited; otherwise create new files directly.

FILES TO CREATE (NEW)
1) monitoring/sources.json
   - contains an array of sources with:
     { "id": "pt-aima", "label": "Portugal AIMA", "countrySlug": "portugal", "pathwayKey": null, "url": "...", "keywords": ["visa","residence","permit"] }

   Initialize with a SMALL starter list (official only) for:
   - Portugal (AIMA + tax authority portal)
   - Spain (immigration ministry / consular visa info + tax agency)
   - UK (gov.uk skilled worker page)
   - Canada (IRCC relevant page)
   - Malta (residency authority page)
   - Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador (official immigration authority pages if known; if uncertain, include placeholder entries with url = "" and skip those in the runner)

2) monitoring/state.json
   - initial empty object:
     { "version": 1, "lastRunAt": "", "hashes": {} }

3) scripts/monitoring/hash-monitor.mjs
   Implement:
   - load sources.json
   - for each source with a non-empty url:
     - fetch(url) with timeout (use AbortController)
     - take response text
     - normalize (strip script/style tags with regex, collapse whitespace)
     - sha256(normalizedText)
   - compare with state.hashes[source.id]
   - if changed:
     - add entry to proposals list:
       { id, countrySlug, pathwayKey, url, detectedAt, severity: "P2", summary: "Source content changed (hash diff). Review for decision-impacting updates." }
   - update state.hashes[source.id] = newHash
   - update state.lastRunAt = ISO timestamp
   - write monitoring/proposals.json always (even if empty)
   - exit code:
     - 0 always (we don’t want workflow red on change)

4) scripts/monitoring/README.md
   - short doc: how it works, what PR means, how to triage P0/P1/P2 manually today

5) .github/workflows/monitor-briefs.yml
   Schedule:
   - weekly baseline (every Monday 14:00 UTC)
   - plus 2 additional runs per week (Wed/Fri 14:00 UTC) to approximate “high volatility 2–3x/week” for now
   Also allow manual run (workflow_dispatch).

   Steps:
   - checkout
   - setup node 20
   - run: node scripts/monitoring/hash-monitor.mjs
   - use peter-evans/create-pull-request to open PR ONLY if there are file changes in monitoring/state.json or monitoring/proposals.json
     PR title: "Monitoring: source changes detected"
     PR body: include count of proposals and link to proposals.json

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- Use Node 20’s built-in fetch.
- Use crypto from node:crypto for sha256.
- Use fs/promises.
- Make the runner resilient: if a fetch fails, add a proposal entry severity P2: "Source unreachable" and continue (do not crash).
- Skip sources with empty url.

OUTPUT
- Create all 5 files above with correct content.
- Do NOT modify package.json.
- Do NOT modify existing TS monitoring framework yet.
- After creating, summarize how to enable it on GitHub (permissions: Actions enabled; GITHUB_TOKEN default is fine).

STOP after completing these files.
