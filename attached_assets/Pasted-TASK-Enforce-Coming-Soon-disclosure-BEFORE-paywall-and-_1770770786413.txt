TASK: Enforce “Coming Soon” disclosure BEFORE paywall and apply smarter gating rules for Resources/Vendors/Community.

GUARDRAILS
- Do NOT change routing/nav/tab layout.
- Do NOT change subscription providers (EntitlementContext, SubscriptionContext bridge).
- FULL FILE REPLACEMENTS ONLY.
- Ask for files ONE AT A TIME.
- No new dependencies.

REQUIREMENTS
We are launching with 8 countries:
Portugal, Spain, Canada, Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador, Malta, UK.
All other countries must show “Coming Soon” BEFORE any purchase prompt.

SMARTER GATING RULE (replace simplistic “all behind paywall”)
For any countrySlug:
1) If country is NOT in the 8 launch list:
   - Always show Coming Soon screen/message (never ProPaywall)
2) If country IS in the 8 launch list but the specific content is not decision-ready:
   - Show Coming Soon screen/message (never ProPaywall)
3) Only show ProPaywall when BOTH are true:
   - country is in the 8 launch list
   - content is decision-ready AND designated as Pro-gated

APPLY THIS TO:
- Country hub pages (entry page for each country)
- Resources, Vendors, Community screens (both global and country-level versions if present)
- Any pathway locked screens should also respect Coming Soon (Coming Soon beats paywall)

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH
A) Add a single source of truth for launch + readiness.
   If src/data/coverage.ts exists, use it.
   If it does NOT exist, create it with:
   - LAUNCH_COUNTRIES: string[]
   - isLaunchCountry(slug): boolean
   - isDecisionReady(slug, pathwayKey?, section?): boolean
     section = "brief" | "resources" | "vendors" | "community" | "pathway"

Initialize:
- Portugal + Spain: decision-ready for brief + pathways (d7/d8, nlv/dnv).
- For Canada, Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador, Malta, UK: brief = coming-soon (at minimum), and resources/vendors/community coming-soon.
- All non-launch countries: everything coming-soon.

B) Create a reusable “AvailabilityGate”
Create src/components/AvailabilityGate.tsx:
Props:
- countrySlug?: string
- pathwayKey?: string
- section: "brief" | "resources" | "vendors" | "community" | "pathway"
- children: ReactNode
Behavior:
- If NOT launch country -> render <ComingSoon ... />
- If launch but NOT decision-ready -> render <ComingSoon ... />
- Else render children

C) Create a minimal ComingSoon component (if not already present)
Create src/components/ComingSoon.tsx:
Props:
- title: string
- message: string
- ctaLabel?: string (optional)
- onPressCta?: () => void (optional)
Keep it consistent with tokens + Screen.

D) Wire it into target screens (ONE AT A TIME)
Ask me for these files in this order and provide full replacements:
1) app/(tabs)/country/[slug]/index.tsx  (Country hub)
   Wrap the page content inside AvailabilityGate(section="brief")
   Show a Coverage block at top listing Ready vs Coming Soon (minimal)

2) app/(tabs)/country/[slug]/resources.tsx
   Wrap inside AvailabilityGate(section="resources")
   If available, then apply ProGate to paid content
   Rule: Coming Soon must block before ProGate

3) app/(tabs)/country/[slug]/vendors.tsx
   Wrap inside AvailabilityGate(section="vendors")
   Coming Soon beats ProGate

4) app/(tabs)/country/[slug]/community.tsx (or community/index if that’s what exists)
   Wrap inside AvailabilityGate(section="community")
   Coming Soon beats ProGate

5) src/components/ProPaywall.tsx
   Add short “Coverage note” under pricing (no dates, no promises)

STOP after #5 and summarize changes in 5 bullets, including which sections are now gated and how Coming Soon works.

BEGIN BY ASKING ME FOR:
- Whether src/data/coverage.ts exists. If it exists, ask me to paste it.
- If it doesn’t exist, create it as described.
