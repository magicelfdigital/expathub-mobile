PROMPT: Redesign Monetization Model for ExpatHub

We are redesigning ExpatHub’s monetization model from subscription-only to a 3-tier structure aligned with immigration planning behavior.

Objective

Shift from:

$14.99/month

$99/year

To:

30-Day Decision Pass (primary product)

Country Lifetime Unlock (one-time per country)

Ongoing Monthly Access (optional)

Do not remove subscription capability. Reframe it.

Product Structure to Implement
1️⃣ 30-Day Decision Pass (Consumable / Time-Limited Access)

Product ID: decision_pass_30d

Includes:

All countries

All pathways

Comparison engine

Risk/failure sections

Full access to premium content

Access expires after 30 days from purchase.

After expiration:

Lock premium content

Show upgrade options

This becomes the default recommended purchase option.

2️⃣ Country Lifetime Unlock (Non-Consumable)

Product ID format:
country_lifetime_<slug>
Example:

country_lifetime_portugal

country_lifetime_spain

Includes:

All pathways in that country

Comparison involving that country

Future updates for that country

Never expires

Does NOT include:

Other countries

3️⃣ Ongoing Monthly Access (Subscription)

Product ID: expithub_monthly

Includes:

Full platform access

Continuous updates

Multi-country comparison

Designed for long-term planners

Repositioned as optional, not default.

Access Logic Rules

Access is granted if ANY of the following is true:

User has active decision_pass_30d

User has lifetime unlock for that country

User has active monthly subscription

Decision pass overrides all country locks.

Country lifetime unlock overrides that specific country only.

Subscription overrides all.

Post-Expiration Behavior

When 30-Day Pass expires:

Lock premium content

Preserve saved countries

Show pricing modal with:

Renew 30-Day Pass

Upgrade to Country Lifetime

Subscribe Monthly

Do NOT auto-renew decision pass.

Pricing Page Changes

Rewrite pricing page to:

Headline:
“Avoid costly immigration mistakes.”

Primary CTA:
“Start 30-Day Decision Access”

Secondary:
“Unlock Portugal Forever”
“Unlock Spain Forever”
“Continue with Monthly Access”

Remove annual plan.

RevenueCat Requirements

Create:

Consumable: 30-Day Pass

Non-consumables: Country lifetime unlocks

Subscription: Monthly plan

Ensure entitlements are structured cleanly:

decision_access

country_portugal

country_spain

full_access_subscription

Access logic should check entitlements, not product IDs directly.

UI Changes Required

Update Subscribe screen layout

Add country-specific lifetime unlock button inside country hub

Add expiration indicator for 30-Day pass

Update locked.tsx messaging to reflect new pricing options

Important Constraints

Keep architecture simple

Do not refactor entire navigation

Do not add new features beyond pricing logic

Preserve current pathway content

After Implementation

Provide:

Updated entitlement logic

Pricing screen layout structure

Access guard logic example
