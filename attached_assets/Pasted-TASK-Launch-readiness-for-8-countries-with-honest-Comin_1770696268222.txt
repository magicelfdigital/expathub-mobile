TASK: Launch readiness for 8 countries with honest “Coming Soon” disclosure BEFORE purchase.

GUARDRAILS
- Do NOT change Expo Router routing, folder structure, or navigation layouts.
- Do NOT change subscription logic (RevenueCat/Stripe), EntitlementContext, or ProGate mechanics.
- Do NOT add auth, databases, or external services.
- Ask me for files ONE AT A TIME and provide FULL FILE REPLACEMENTS ONLY.
- Keep UI layouts mostly the same; only add minimal “Coverage / Coming Soon” UI blocks.

GOAL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
We are launching with 8 countries: Portugal, Spain, Canada, Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador, Malta, UK.
Any country/pathway that is not ready MUST clearly show “Coming Soon” BEFORE a user purchases.
No vaporware. No hidden gaps.

DEFINITIONS
- “Decision-Ready” = has a complete Decision Brief (Work Access Matrix + mistakes + best alternatives).
- “Coming Soon” = brief not written/validated yet. Must be labeled everywhere users would expect it.

WHAT TO IMPLEMENT

1) DATA: Coverage map
Create or update a single source of truth that describes coverage status per country + pathway.
- File to create (if not existing): src/data/coverage.ts
- Export:
  - type CoverageStatus = "decision-ready" | "coming-soon"
  - type CoverageItem = { countrySlug: string; pathwayKey?: string; status: CoverageStatus; label: string }
  - function getCountryCoverage(countrySlug): { ready: CoverageItem[]; soon: CoverageItem[] }
  - function isDecisionReady(countrySlug, pathwayKey?): boolean

Initialize coverage so that:
- Portugal: d7, d8 = decision-ready
- Spain: nlv, dnv = decision-ready
- Canada, Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador, Malta, UK = coming-soon at least at country level (and any pathways listed should be coming-soon unless explicitly marked ready)

2) UI: Pre-purchase disclosure (must appear before paywall)
Update the COUNTRY HUB landing screen (app/(tabs)/country/[slug]/index.tsx) to show a “Coverage” block near the top:
- Section title: “Coverage”
- Show two lists:
  - “Decision-Ready” (with checkmark)
  - “Coming Soon” (with clock)
- If a user taps a Coming Soon pathway item, it should go to a Coming Soon screen (NOT paywall).

3) UI: Pathways list badges
Wherever pathways are listed (country hub, pathway list screen, etc.), add a small badge:
- “Ready” for decision-ready
- “Coming soon” for coming-soon
This badge must be visible before any ProPaywall is shown.

4) Paywall: Honest coverage disclosure
Update ProPaywall copy (or the component that renders it) to include a short “Coverage note” below pricing:
Example text (keep short):
“Decision-Ready now: Portugal (D7/D8), Spain (NLV/DNV). Coming soon: Canada, UK, Malta, Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador.”
No dates. No promises.

IMPORTANT LOGIC RULES
- ProGate should only block content that is decision-ready and intended to be Pro.
- Coming Soon content should NOT send users to subscribe; it should show the Coming Soon screen.
- If any screen is behind ProGate today (resources/vendors/community), and the country is coming-soon, those screens must show Coming Soon instead of paywall.

EXECUTION ORDER (ONE FILE AT A TIME)
A) Ask me for: src/data/coverage.ts (if doesn’t exist, say so and you will create it)
   - Provide FULL replacement / new file content.
B) Ask me for: app/(tabs)/country/[slug]/index.tsx
   - Provide FULL replacement adding Coverage block + badge logic.
C) Ask me for: src/components/ProPaywall.tsx
   - Provide FULL replacement adding the “Coverage note” text.
STOP after C and summarize what changed in 3 bullets.
