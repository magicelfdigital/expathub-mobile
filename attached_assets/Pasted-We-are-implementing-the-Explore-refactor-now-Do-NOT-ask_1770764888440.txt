We are implementing the Explore refactor now. Do NOT ask me conceptual questions—just ask for files one at a time and provide full replacements only.

GUARDRAILS
- Do NOT change tab layout config or rename tabs.
- Do NOT change routing structure for Countries.
- Do NOT change subscription logic (RevenueCat/Stripe), EntitlementContext, ProGate, or paywall behavior.
- FULL FILE REPLACEMENTS ONLY.
- ASK FOR FILES ONE AT A TIME.
- Keep styling consistent with tokens and existing Screen component patterns.
- Avoid adding logos in page bodies if headers already show them.

GOAL
Explore must NOT duplicate Countries.
Explore should help users who haven’t picked a country by offering decision-first entry points and a lightweight compare view.
Countries remains the full directory + hub entry.

EXPLORE V1 CONTENT
Replace Explore with 4 decision entry cards:
1) "I need to keep working"
   Subtitle: "Remote work rules vary. Start with options that explicitly allow it and don’t quietly trap you later."
   Route: /(tabs)/explore/remote-work

2) "I want a local job (sponsorship)"
   Subtitle: "Employer sponsorship is often the real gate. Learn what’s realistic before you invest time."
   Route: /(tabs)/explore/sponsorship

3) "I’m not sure yet — I want flexibility"
   Subtitle: "If you’re still deciding, choose paths that preserve options and buy time legally."
   Route: /(tabs)/explore/flexibility

4) "I care about long-term residency (PR)"
   Subtitle: "Some visas are dead ends. Start with options aligned to PR pathways and work rights."
   Route: /(tabs)/explore/pr

Add a bottom secondary CTA:
- "Browse all countries" -> /(tabs)/country

COMPARE (LIGHTWEIGHT)
On Explore, below the cards, add a compact “Compare” section that shows 3 toggles (chips):
- Remote work
- Local job/sponsorship
- PR path

When a chip is selected, show a simple list of the 8 launch countries with a 1-line summary for that dimension and a badge:
- "Ready" vs "Coming soon" using src/data/coverage.ts if it exists (preferred).
If coverage.ts is missing, implement a minimal local map just for badges (Portugal/Spain ready, others coming soon).

TOPIC SCREENS
Create these screens:
- app/(tabs)/explore/remote-work.tsx
- app/(tabs)/explore/sponsorship.tsx
- app/(tabs)/explore/flexibility.tsx
- app/(tabs)/explore/pr.tsx

Each topic screen must include:
- Short explainer paragraph (2–4 lines)
- Curated list of relevant countries (subset of the 8)
- Each row shows country name + badge Ready/Coming soon + “Open →”
- Tap navigates to /(tabs)/country/[slug]
- No paywall here

IMPLEMENTATION ORDER (MANDATORY)
1) Ask me for the current Explore screen file path and contents (likely app/(tabs)/explore.tsx). Provide full replacement.
2) Create the 4 topic screen files. Provide full contents for each.
3) If you need coverage badges and src/data/coverage.ts exists, ask for it. If not, do NOT create it today—use a minimal local map for badges.

STOP after step 2 (and step 3 only if absolutely required to compile).
Summarize changes in 3 bullets.
