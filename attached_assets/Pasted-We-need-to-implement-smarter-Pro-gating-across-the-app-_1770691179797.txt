We need to implement smarter Pro gating across the app using existing ProGate + ProPaywall.

GUARDRAILS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
- Do NOT change Expo Router structure, route names, or folder layout.
- Do NOT refactor navigation or providers.
- Do NOT change subscription purchase logic (RevenueCat/Stripe).
- Use existing ProGate and ProPaywall; do NOT duplicate paywall logic inside screens.
- Ask for files ONE AT A TIME and provide FULL FILE REPLACEMENTS ONLY.
- Keep UI behavior and layout the same except where gated.

SMART GATING RULE (AUTHORITATIVE)

FREE (no paywall):
1) Home tab and its content
2) Explore tab and its content (browsing and comparing at a high level)
3) Countries list screen: /(tabs)/country
4) Country hub landing: /(tabs)/country/[slug]  (the “hub” page with cards to Resources/Vendors/Community)
   - This screen stays free so users can see what’s inside.
5) Top-level Community tab landing: /(tabs)/community/index
   - Make this a TEASER page only (no real community content).
   - It should show:
     - what community will include
     - examples of what you can do with Pro
     - CTA to subscribe

PRO-ONLY (requires Pro):
A) Country Resources: /(tabs)/country/[slug]/resources
B) Country Vendors: /(tabs)/country/[slug]/vendors
C) Country Community (country-scoped): /(tabs)/country/[slug]/community
D) Any “full guide” pathway content that is already gated (keep existing behavior)
E) Any future advanced tools (if found)

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
- Wrap ONLY the PRO-ONLY screens with <ProGate countrySlug={...} pathwayKey={... optional} />
- Do not gate the country hub landing page; it should remain accessible and act as the upsell gateway.
- Ensure contextual paywall messaging:
  - For A/B/C screens, pass countrySlug into ProGate so ProPaywall can show country-scoped messaging.
  - If a pathwayKey exists, pass it too.
- No content leaks: when gated, the underlying list/cards should not render.
- Deep links: opening a Pro-only screen directly should show paywall; after successful purchase/restore, it should render the intended screen.

FILES TO UPDATE (IN ORDER)
1) app/(tabs)/country/[slug]/resources.tsx   (wrap with ProGate; pass slug)
2) app/(tabs)/country/[slug]/vendors.tsx    (wrap with ProGate; pass slug)
3) app/(tabs)/country/[slug]/community.tsx  (wrap with ProGate; pass slug)
4) app/(tabs)/community/index.tsx
   - Convert to a TEASER page:
     - remove any real community lists/links if present
     - add a clear CTA to subscribe
     - optionally include “preview” examples that do not require Pro
5) Search for any other screens that expose resources/vendors/community content and gate them if they are not explicitly in the FREE list above.

OUTPUT FORMAT
For each file:
- Ask me for the file path + current contents (ONE FILE ONLY)
- Return a FULL replacement for that file only
- Briefly state what changed (1-2 lines)
Then move to the next file.

STOP CONDITION
Stop after the above files are updated and report:
- Which routes are Pro-only
- Which routes remain free
- Any additional places where gated content might leak (if found)
