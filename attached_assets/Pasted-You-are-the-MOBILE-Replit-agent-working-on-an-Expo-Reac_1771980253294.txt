You are the MOBILE Replit agent working on an Expo React Native app.

Problem:
On iPad, the app content is centered but there is a lot of BLACK space/gutters around the app. This is happening in the app itself (not just in App Store screenshot previews). The current large-screen wrapper uses maxWidth ~700 and likely doesn’t set background color on the true outer container.

Goal:
Make iPad layout look intentional: wider content area, no black gutters, correct background fills the full screen. Keep phone layout unchanged.

Tasks (do ALL):
1) Fix the outermost background:
   - Ensure the top-level SafeAreaView (or outer container) has:
     - flex: 1
     - backgroundColor set to the app’s normal background (likely white or theme background)
   - The background MUST fill the entire iPad screen.

2) Adjust large-screen width constraints:
   - Increase large-screen maxWidth from 700 to 900 (or 1000 if needed) so the app does not look like a narrow phone column on iPad.
   - Keep width: "100%" on the inner container so it stretches up to maxWidth.
   - Apply centering (alignItems: "center") only on large screens.

3) Remove accidental extra centering constraints:
   - Search for and remove/avoid any of these on wrappers/ScrollViews that could shrink content further:
     - alignSelf: "center"
     - width: some fixed number
     - maxWidth applied twice (parent + child)
   - Ensure ScrollView contentContainerStyle does not force a narrow centered column unless it uses width:"100%".

4) Preserve behavior:
   - Phone layout must remain identical (no visual changes on width < 768).
   - Do not modify business logic, navigation, paywall/IAP, or API code.

Output:
- Exact files changed
- Code diffs / patches
- Confirm which maxWidth you chose (900 or 1000) and why.
- Confirm background color is applied at the top-level container so there are no black gutters on iPad.

Acceptance:
- On iPad portrait and landscape, the background fills the entire screen (no black margins).
- Content area is wider than before and looks tablet-appropriate.
- On iPhone, nothing changes.
