TASK: Implement Decision Brief Freshness & Accuracy System (Data + Rules only)

GOAL
Introduce a canonical freshness, accuracy, and audit model for Decision Briefs.
This does NOT add automation or agents yet.
This is foundational data structure + validation rules only.

GUARDRAILS
- Do NOT change navigation, UI, routing, or paywall behavior
- Do NOT introduce background jobs or agents yet
- FULL FILE REPLACEMENTS ONLY
- Create new files where appropriate
- Do NOT remove existing fields; extend safely

WHAT TO BUILD

1) Extend DecisionBrief type

If DecisionBrief type exists:
- Replace the file entirely with an extended version
If it does NOT exist:
- Create src/data/decisionBrief.ts

DecisionBrief must include:

- id: string
- countrySlug: string
- pathwayKey?: string
- title: string
- summary: string

NEW FRESHNESS / TRUST FIELDS
- lastReviewedAt: string (ISO date)
- updatedAt: string (ISO date)
- confidenceLevel: "high" | "medium" | "low"
- sourceLinks: {
    label: string
    url: string
    type: "official" | "secondary"
  }[]
- changeLog: {
    date: string (ISO)
    summary: string
    severity: "P0" | "P1" | "P2"
  }[]

2) Define Severity Levels & SLAs

Create src/data/briefSeverity.ts exporting:

- Severity definition:
  P0 = user-facing legality / eligibility / rights changed
  P1 = material process, threshold, or timeline change
  P2 = wording, links, clarifications, non-decision impact

- SLAs:
  P0 → review within 48 hours
  P1 → review within 7 days
  P2 → review within 30 days

Export helper:
- getSLAForSeverity(severity)

3) Mandatory Review Triggers

Create src/data/briefReviewRules.ts exporting:

- requiresImmediateReview(brief): boolean
  returns true if:
   - confidenceLevel === "low"
   - lastReviewedAt older than 6 months
   - any P0 change in changeLog within last 90 days

- requiresScheduledReview(brief): boolean
  returns true if:
   - lastReviewedAt older than 90 days
   - any P1 change in last 6 months

4) Validation Helper (non-UI)

Create src/data/briefValidation.ts exporting:

- validateBrief(brief): {
    valid: boolean
    warnings: string[]
  }

Warnings include:
- missing sourceLinks
- no official sources
- confidenceLevel = "low"
- lastReviewedAt > 6 months ago

NO UI changes yet — this is for later surfacing.

5) Documentation

Create src/data/DECISION_BRIEF_TRUST_MODEL.md explaining:
- why freshness exists
- what confidenceLevel means
- how severity is used
- how this protects user trust

OUTPUT
- Create / replace files as described
- Ensure types are exported cleanly
- Do not reference agents, automation, or GitHub Actions yet

STOP after implementation.
