We are implementing a canonical “Work Access Matrix” across all Decision Briefs. This is the core paid value of the app.

GUARDRAILS
- Do NOT change navigation, routes, or folder structure.
- Do NOT change subscription logic (RevenueCat/Stripe) or entitlement providers.
- Do NOT add dependencies.
- Provide FULL FILE REPLACEMENTS ONLY.
- Ask for files ONE AT A TIME.
- Keep UI behavior the same except improved Decision Brief content/structure.

OBJECTIVE
Create a reusable Work Access Matrix model and apply it to all Decision Briefs so every country/pathway answers:
- What work is allowed (remote, self-employed, local employment)
- Whether sponsorship is required
- Whether the pathway blocks future work authorization
- Dependents’ work rights (if known; otherwise mark Unclear)
- Enforcement risk + reviewer scrutiny points
- Clear “recommended strategy” and “best alternative” outputs

STEP 1 — Create/Update data model
If `src/data/decisionBriefs.ts` does not exist, create it.
If it exists, update it.

DecisionBrief must include:
- id: string
- countrySlug: string
- pathwayKey?: string
- headline: string
- bottomLine: string
- workAccess: {
    remoteWork: "Allowed" | "Restricted" | "NotAllowed" | "Unclear";
    selfEmployment: "Allowed" | "Restricted" | "NotAllowed" | "Unclear";
    localEmployment: "Allowed" | "RequiresSponsorship" | "NotAllowed" | "Unclear";
    localBusiness: "Allowed" | "Restricted" | "NotAllowed" | "Unclear";
    canTransitionToLocalWork: "Yes" | "Sometimes" | "UsuallyNo" | "Unclear";
    prPath: "Direct" | "Indirect" | "NotDesignedForPR" | "Unclear";
    dependentsWorkRights: "Yes" | "Sometimes" | "No" | "Unclear";
    enforcementRisk: "Low" | "Medium" | "High";
    reviewerScrutiny: string[];   // 3-5 bullets
    bestFit: string[];            // 3-5 bullets
    notAFitIf: string[];          // 3-5 bullets
    recommendedStrategy: string;  // 1 sentence
    bestAlternatives: string[];   // 2-4 options
  }
- commonMistakes: string[]        // 3-5
- confidenceLevel: "High" | "Medium" | "Conditional"
- lastReviewedAt: string

Export helper functions:
- getDecisionBrief(countrySlug: string, pathwayKey?: string)
- getDecisionBriefsForCountry(countrySlug: string)

STEP 2 — Populate briefs (v1 scope)
Populate briefs for these countries:
Portugal, Spain, Canada, Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador, Malta, UK

Include at minimum these pathway briefs as “live”:
- Portugal: d7, d8
- Spain: nlv, dnv
- UK: skilled-worker (at least as a brief)
- Canada: express-entry (at least as a brief)

For all other pathways/countries where details are uncertain, still create a brief but set fields honestly to "Unclear" and confidenceLevel to "Conditional", and include a “Coming soon / under review” bottomLine that does NOT promise dates.

The tone must be advisor-like and opinionated:
- Highlight sponsorship realities
- Clarify what each pathway does NOT allow
- Explicitly warn about “door-closing” choices

STEP 3 — Wire Decision Briefs into Pro offer messaging
Update `src/data/pro-offer.ts` so Pro offer bullets and mistakes reflect:
- work/sponsorship clarity
- avoiding door-closing decisions
- reviewer scrutiny + enforcement risk
Do not change its exported signature or shape.

OUTPUT FORMAT
1) Ask me for `src/data/decisionBriefs.ts` (or confirm if it doesn’t exist and you will create it)
2) Provide a FULL replacement for that file
3) Ask me for `src/data/pro-offer.ts`
4) Provide a FULL replacement for that file
Stop after these two files.

Do not modify UI components in this task.
