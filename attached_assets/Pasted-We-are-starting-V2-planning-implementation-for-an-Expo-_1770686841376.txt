We are starting V2 planning + implementation for an Expo (React Native) app using Expo Router.

ABSOLUTE GUARDRAILS (DO NOT BREAK)
- Do NOT refactor navigation or change the Expo Router folder/file structure.
- Do NOT rename or move route files/folders.
- Do NOT rewrite providers or add new global contexts.
- EntitlementContext + SubscriptionContext are already implemented; do NOT change subscription logic unless there is a proven bug.
- Ask for files ONE AT A TIME and provide FULL FILE REPLACEMENTS ONLY.

V2 PRIORITY ORDER (MUST FOLLOW)
Phase 1) Data Foundation
Phase 2) Subscription Packaging
Phase 3) Trust Layer
Phase 4) Community V2
Phase 5) Vendors V2

PHASE 1 — DATA FOUNDATION (START HERE)
Goal: eliminate hardcoded arrays scattered across screens and centralize data behind a single access layer.

Deliverables for Phase 1:
1) Define canonical data schemas/types:
   - Country, Resource, Vendor, CommunityLink
   Include fields: id, countrySlug, title/name, url, sourceType, tags/categories, lastReviewedAt, updatedAt.
2) Create a single data access layer:
   - src/data/index.ts (or src/data/api.ts) that exposes functions like:
     - getCountries()
     - getCountry(slug)
     - getResources(countrySlug)
     - getVendors(countrySlug)
     - getCommunityLinks(countrySlug)
3) Migrate existing TEMP arrays (currently embedded in screens) into ONE place.
   - Use local JSON files first (fastest) unless Supabase is explicitly requested.
4) Update screens to consume the data access layer (no direct hardcoded arrays in screens).
5) Keep UI behavior identical (no redesign).

OUTPUT FORMAT
Step 1: List the exact new files you will create and dependencies (if any). (No code changes yet.)
Step 2: Ask me for the first file you need (ONE FILE ONLY).
Step 3: Provide a FULL replacement for that file only.
Repeat.

NOTES
- Keep it boring and safe: minimal changes, no churn.
- If you think something should be renamed/moved, STOP and ask first.
