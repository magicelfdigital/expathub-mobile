Role: You are a senior product engineer working on an Expo / React Native app called ExpatHub.
Goal: Implement a formal freshness, accuracy, and trust system for Decision Briefs.
Do not change navigation, UI layout, or existing business logic unless explicitly instructed.

1️⃣ Add canonical metadata to Decision Briefs

Create or update the shared type definitions so every Decision Brief (country-level and pathway-level) includes the following metadata:

type ConfidenceLevel = "high" | "medium" | "low";

type ChangeLogEntry = {
  date: string; // ISO date
  severity: "P0" | "P1" | "P2";
  summary: string;
  source?: string; // optional official URL
};

type DecisionBriefMeta = {
  lastReviewedAt: string; // ISO date — human or approved agent review
  updatedAt: string;     // ISO date — any content change
  confidenceLevel: ConfidenceLevel;
  sourceLinks: string[]; // official authorities only
  changeLog: ChangeLogEntry[];
};


Attach DecisionBriefMeta to:

Country decision briefs

Pathway decision briefs

Do not remove or rename existing fields.

2️⃣ Enforce review & confidence rules (logic only, no UI yet)

Implement helper logic (pure functions, no side effects) that:

Automatically sets confidenceLevel to:

"low" if:

Any open P0 change exists

Or lastReviewedAt is overdue

"medium" if:

A P1 change exists but review is pending

"high" only if:

Reviewed within the last 60 days

No open P0 or P1 issues

Do not block rendering yet — this is data-layer only.

3️⃣ Define severity standards (constants)

Create a shared constants file defining severity meanings (for internal use only):

P0 (Critical):

Eligibility criteria

Income thresholds

Work rights / sponsorship

Program suspension or termination

P1 (Material):

Processing times

Documentation requirements

Tax treatment clarifications

P2 (Informational):

Wording changes

FAQ updates

Minor fee changes

These constants should be reusable by future monitoring agents.

4️⃣ Mandatory review triggers

Create a helper that flags mandatory review required when any of the following fields change:

Eligibility criteria

Work rights

Income thresholds or proof formats

Application portals or authorities

First-year tax residency rules

Processing time change > ±30%

Fee change > ±15%

Return a boolean + severity level.

5️⃣ Source hygiene enforcement

Add lightweight validation ensuring sourceLinks[] only accepts:

Official immigration authority

Official tax authority

Official labor ministry

Embassy or recognized professional body (max 2)

Do not add runtime errors — return warnings for now.

6️⃣ Change log standardization

Ensure all new changeLog entries:

Require date, severity, and summary

Encourage (but do not require) a source

No UI changes required yet.

7️⃣ Guardrails

❌ Do NOT add UI

❌ Do NOT change paywall logic

❌ Do NOT alter navigation

❌ Do NOT surface confidence to users yet

✅ This is a data-foundation task only

8️⃣ Output expectations

Updated type definitions

New helper utilities (pure functions)

No broken imports

App should run with no visual changes

When finished, summarize:

Files changed / added

Any assumptions made
