TASK: Build a v1 “Compare Countries” feature using a decision matrix.

GOAL
Help users compare countries side-by-side on decision-relevant factors.
This lives in Explore (not Countries) and reinforces decision clarity.

GUARDRAILS
- Do NOT change existing navigation structure.
- Do NOT change subscription logic.
- FULL FILE REPLACEMENTS ONLY.
- Ask for files ONE AT A TIME if they already exist.
- No new dependencies.

SCOPE (v1 — deliberately constrained)
- Compare up to 3 countries at a time
- Matrix is read-only (no editing)
- Some rows are free, some are Pro-gated
- Data-driven (not hardcoded in the screen)

STEP 1 — Data model
Create: src/data/compareMatrix.ts

Export:
- type CompareRow = {
    id: string;
    label: string;
    description?: string;
    proOnly?: boolean;
    values: Record<countrySlug, string | "—">;
  }

- export function getCompareMatrix(countrySlugs: string[]): CompareRow[]

INITIAL ROWS (v1 — opinionated and useful):
FREE rows:
- Residency pathways available
- Work allowed without sponsorship (yes/no/limited)
- Path to permanent residency
- Typical timeline (high level)
- Language requirement

PRO rows:
- Work sponsorship reality (what actually works)
- Income thresholds (realistic ranges)
- Tax exposure risk (high/medium/low)
- Bureaucracy difficulty (low/medium/high)
- Who this country is NOT good for

Populate initial values for:
Portugal, Spain, Canada, UK
Use "—" for missing/unknown values (do not guess).

STEP 2 — CompareMatrix UI component
Create: src/components/CompareMatrix.tsx

Props:
- countrySlugs: string[]
- onRemoveCountry?(slug)
- onAddCountry?()

Behavior:
- Render table-like layout:
  left column = row labels
  next columns = countries
- If row.proOnly:
  - Wrap row values in ProGate
  - Non-pro users see blurred text + “Unlock to compare”
- Mobile-first:
  - Horizontal scroll allowed
  - Sticky left column labels

STEP 3 — Wire into Explore
Ask me for: app/(tabs)/explore.tsx

Then update Explore so:
- Add a “Compare countries” card near top
- Allow user to pick 2–3 countries (simple modal or inline picker)
- When selected, render CompareMatrix
- Do NOT move or remove existing Explore sections

STEP 4 — Guardrails
- CompareMatrix must respect AvailabilityGate:
  - Non-launch countries show “Coming Soon” instead of matrix values
- Do NOT route to subscribe directly from CompareMatrix
  (ProGate handles upsell)

STOP after wiring Explore.
Summarize:
- What users can compare
- What is Pro-only
- Why this improves decision clarity
