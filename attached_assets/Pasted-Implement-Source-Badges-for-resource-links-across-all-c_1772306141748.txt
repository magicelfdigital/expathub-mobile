Implement “Source Badges” for resource links across all countries.

Goal:
Display a small badge next to each resource title indicating source type:
OFFICIAL / AUTHORITATIVE / COMMUNITY

Constraints:
- Resources are defined in ONE central file (e.g., resources.ts).
- Do NOT modify entitlements, billing, paywall logic, or routing.
- Do NOT change Planner logic.
- No web browsing. No invented sources. Only classify based on URL domain patterns and existing knowledge of the site type.

---------------------------------------------
1) Data Model Update
---------------------------------------------

In the central resources file (resources.ts), add a required field to each resource item:

sourceType: "official" | "authoritative" | "community"

Rules for classification:
- official:
  government domains and official agencies (e.g., .gov, gov.uk, europa.eu official portals when appropriate, ministries, immigration authorities)
- authoritative:
  recognized institutions/portals that are not direct government agencies but widely authoritative (e.g., major public institutions, EU informational portals if not strictly government-run pages, national health services, etc.)
- community:
  blogs, forums, expat sites, aggregators, commercial advisory content

If uncertain, default to "community" (conservative).

---------------------------------------------
2) UI Component
---------------------------------------------

Create a reusable component:
src/components/SourceBadge.tsx

Props:
- sourceType: "official" | "authoritative" | "community"

Display text mapping:
- official -> "OFFICIAL"
- authoritative -> "AUTHORITATIVE"
- community -> "COMMUNITY"

UX styling requirements:
- small pill badge
- subtle neutral background and border (use existing theme tokens)
- uppercase label
- minimal visual weight (no bright colors, no heavy outlines)
- consistent spacing from title

---------------------------------------------
3) Render Badges in Resource List
---------------------------------------------

Find the component that renders resource items (where resources.ts is consumed).
Update the list item layout:

Resource Title  [SourceBadge]

- Badge should appear inline on the same row as title when space allows.
- If wrapping occurs on small screens, badge can drop to next line but remain close to title.
- Ensure accessibility: add an accessibilityLabel like:
  "Source: OFFICIAL" / "Source: AUTHORITATIVE" / "Source: COMMUNITY"

---------------------------------------------
4) QA / Safety
---------------------------------------------

- Ensure TypeScript passes.
- Ensure every resource item has sourceType (no undefined).
- Verify several countries render resources correctly.
- Confirm no changes to any entitlement or billing files.
- Confirm paywall behavior unchanged.

---------------------------------------------
5) Output
---------------------------------------------

After implementing, output:
- Count of resources updated per sourceType
- List of any resources defaulted to "community" due to uncertainty
- The file(s) changed
