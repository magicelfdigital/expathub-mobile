You are working in an Expo (React Native) app that uses Expo Router file-based routing.

GOALS
1) Implement subscriptions with:
   - Web: Stripe Checkout + Customer Portal
   - Mobile (iOS/Android): RevenueCat (react-native-purchases)
2) Create a SINGLE “entitlement” interface used by the app:
   - hasProAccess: boolean
   - source: "revenuecat" | "stripe" | "none"
   - refresh(): Promise<void>
3) Do NOT change my routing structure or rename files/folders. Do NOT delete files. If you think a file should be moved/renamed, ASK first.

CONSTRAINTS (critical)
- This project uses Expo Router. Do not add React Navigation manually.
- Providers must remain global and mounted once at app root.
- No UI logos in screen bodies. Headers own logos.
- No route params like [slug] in headers.

WHAT TO BUILD (step-by-step)
A) Add dependencies and minimal config for RevenueCat:
   - install react-native-purchases
   - implement src/subscriptions/revenuecat.ts with initPurchases(), getEntitlements(), restorePurchases()
   - on mobile, read entitlement “pro” (or configurable entitlement key) and map to hasProAccess

B) Add minimal Stripe web flow:
   - implement a small Next/Node/Express-like endpoint OR a placeholder server function file for:
     - createCheckoutSession(priceId, customerId?)
     - createCustomerPortalSession(customerId)
   - In the app, add src/subscriptions/stripeWeb.ts that calls those endpoints when Platform.OS === "web"
   - Use placeholder URLs and environment variables; do not hardcode secrets in the client.

C) Create a unified context:
   - src/contexts/EntitlementContext.tsx exports:
     - EntitlementProvider
     - useEntitlement()
   - EntitlementProvider chooses RevenueCat on native and Stripe on web
   - Provide hasProAccess, source, refresh()

D) Update my existing SubscriptionContext to become a thin wrapper OR replace it safely:
   - Keep exported names stable if possible: SubscriptionProvider + useSubscription
   - Internally delegate to EntitlementContext
   - Do not break imports.

E) Update the Subscribe screen:
   - On mobile: show “Subscribe” button that triggers RevenueCat purchase flow (using a placeholder product identifier)
   - On web: show “Subscribe” button that redirects to Stripe Checkout session URL
   - Add “Restore purchases” on mobile (RevenueCat restore)
   - Display current entitlement status

DELIVERABLES
- Give FULL file replacements only.
- Ask me for files ONE AT A TIME.
- Start by listing the exact dependencies you will add and the exact new files you will create.
- Then ask me for app.json/app.config and my current SubscriptionContext file contents (if needed).
