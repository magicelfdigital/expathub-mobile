Context
You are working inside an existing Expo / React Native app called ExpatHub.
Phase 1 (data foundation) and Phase 2 (subscription + gating) are complete.

We are now implementing Decision Briefs, which are the core paid value of the app.

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Implement a Decision Brief system that:

Defines a canonical Decision Brief structure

Rewrites the product value proposition to reflect a hybrid:

thinking partner + expert advisor

Generates Decision Briefs for all supported countries and pathways

Integrates cleanly with existing Pro gating (ProGate / ProPaywall)

1️⃣ Define the Decision Brief model (REQUIRED)

Create a new canonical model:

File: src/data/decisionBriefs.ts

A DecisionBrief must include:

id: string
countrySlug: string
pathwayKey?: string

headline: string
decisionSummary: string

recommendedFor: string[]
notRecommendedFor: string[]

keyRequirements: string[]
financialReality: string[]
timelineReality: string[]
riskFlags: string[]

commonMistakes: string[]
betterAlternatives?: string[]

confidenceLevel: "High" | "Medium" | "Conditional"

lastReviewedAt: string


Add helper functions:

getDecisionBrief(countrySlug, pathwayKey?)

getDecisionBriefsForCountry(countrySlug)

No UI logic in this file — data only.

2️⃣ Rewrite the product value proposition (REQUIRED)

Update all Pro-facing copy so ExpatHub is positioned as:

“A decision partner that helps people avoid bad relocation decisions before they commit time, money, or legal risk.”

Specifically:

Replace language like “guides, resources, access”

Use language like:

“decision clarity”

“risk-aware guidance”

“what actually works for people like you”

“who this path is NOT right for”

Update:

ProPaywall headline + subhead

CTA labels

Any generic “Unlock Pro” copy

Do not change pricing.

3️⃣ Generate Decision Briefs for all countries (REQUIRED)

Using existing country + pathway data:

Create at least one Decision Brief per country

Create pathway-specific briefs where pathways exist

Content should be:

Opinionated

Cautious

Explicit about downsides

Clear about tradeoffs

Avoid marketing language.
Write like an experienced advisor trying to prevent mistakes.

4️⃣ Integrate Decision Briefs into gating (REQUIRED)

All Resources, Vendors, and Community remain behind Pro

The Decision Brief is the first thing shown on gated screens

Community and vendors should feel like supporting evidence, not the product

Do not change navigation or routing.

5️⃣ Guardrails

Do NOT add auth or user accounts

Do NOT add commenting yet

Do NOT change subscription logic

Do NOT touch RevenueCat or Stripe code

This is a content + structure phase, not infrastructure.

✅ Success Criteria

When done:

A user can open a country or pathway

See a Decision Brief immediately

Understand:

“Is this right for me?”

“What could go wrong?”

“What’s the smarter alternative?”

And feel the subscription is justified before community exists

If anything is ambiguous, make a reasonable product decision and proceed.

Why this works (for you, not Replit)

This prompt:

Forces structure before community

Makes pricing feel justified without changing it

Turns “information” into judgment

Sets up v3 community cleanly, later

When Replit finishes, your next move will be:

attach community threads to individual Decision Brief sections

If you want, next we can:

Define the exact brief template you’ll reuse forever, or

Design community prompts that don’t turn into Reddit, or

Decide when (and if) pricing should increase

Just say the number.
