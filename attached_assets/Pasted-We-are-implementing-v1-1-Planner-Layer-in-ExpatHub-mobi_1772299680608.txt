We are implementing v1.1 Planner Layer in ExpatHub mobile app (Expo SDK 54, expo-router, React Context, AsyncStorage, EntitlementContext already exists).

Goal:
Add a semi-linear 6-step relocation planning system with calm, structured UX tone.

Constraints:
- No backend changes
- Local persistence only (AsyncStorage)
- Only paid users can activate plan
- No pricing changes
- No major layout redesign
- Maintain current theme/tokens
- Tone must remain calm, steady, advisory (no hype, no urgency language)

-----------------------------------------
1️⃣ PlanContext
-----------------------------------------

Create src/contexts/PlanContext.tsx

State:
- activeCountrySlug: string | null
- activePathwayId: string | null
- completedSteps: string[]

Methods:
- startPlan(countrySlug: string, pathwayId: string)
- completeStep(stepId: string)
- resetPlan()

Persist state to AsyncStorage.

Only allow one active plan at a time.

-----------------------------------------
2️⃣ Country Page Integration ([slug]/index.tsx)
-----------------------------------------

After pathway content, insert:

Focus Activation Section (Paid Only)

Title:
"Turn this into a structured plan"

Body:
"If this country feels like a strong option, you can focus here and walk through the process step by step."

Button:
"Focus on {CountryName}"

Microcopy:
"You can switch your focus at any time."

If activeCountrySlug === slug:
Render PlanModule at top of page.

-----------------------------------------
3️⃣ PlanModule Component
-----------------------------------------

At top display:

Title:
"{CountryName} Plan"

Subtext:
"We’ll walk through this step by step."

Progress:
"{X} of 6 steps completed"

Recommended next:
"Recommended next step: {FirstIncompleteStepTitle}"

All steps clickable (semi-linear).
Highlight first incomplete step.

No exclamation marks.
No urgency language.

-----------------------------------------
4️⃣ 6-Step Structure
-----------------------------------------

Fixed steps:

1. Confirm Your Legal Pathway
   "Make sure this visa category fits your situation and long-term goals."

2. Validate Financial Requirements
   "Review income, savings, and cost thresholds to ensure the numbers work."

3. Prepare Core Documentation
   "Identify required documents and begin gathering them early."

4. Execute the Residency Process
   "Understand where and how to apply, including appointments and approvals."

5. Register & Activate Local Systems
   "Plan for tax registration, healthcare enrollment, and local requirements."

6. Post-Arrival Compliance
   "Stay aligned with renewal rules and residency obligations."

Each step:
- Expandable
- Contains checklist items
- Toggle completion
- No dependency engine

-----------------------------------------
5️⃣ EligibilitySnapshot Component (Inside Step 1)

Do NOT use:

-----------------------------------------
6️⃣ LifetimeOfferBanner
-----------------------------------------

Tone Rules (Critical)
-----------------------------------------

- Calm, steady, advisory tone
- No exclamation marks
- No hype language
- No urgency timers
- No guilt phrasing
- Avoid US-centric terminology
- Use neutral phrasing (home country / destination country)
