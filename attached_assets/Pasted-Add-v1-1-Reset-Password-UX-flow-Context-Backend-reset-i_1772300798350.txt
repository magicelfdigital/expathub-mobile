Add v1.1 "Reset Password" UX flow.

Context:
- Backend reset is already handled by expathub.website with email-based reset (do not build new backend).
- Mobile should initiate the reset request and show a calm confirmation state.
- Avoid account enumeration. Use neutral success messaging even if email is not found.

Requirements:

1) Login Screen
- Add a text link under the password field: "Forgot password?"
- Tapping it routes to a new screen/route: /auth/forgot-password (or equivalent within your expo-router structure).

2) Forgot Password Screen (new)
UI:
- Title: "Reset password"
- Body: "We’ll email you a link to reset your password."
- Email input field
- Primary button: "Send reset link"
- Secondary link: "Back to sign in"

Behavior:
- Validate email format on client (basic).
- On submit, call backend endpoint (use whichever exists today on expathub.website; check current auth routes first):
  Preferred: POST /api/auth/forgot-password  { email }
  Alternate: POST /api/auth/request-password-reset  { email }
  Alternate: POST /api/auth/reset/request  { email }

- If endpoint returns 200/202 success:
  Show success state:
    "If an account exists for that email, you’ll receive a reset link shortly."
  Provide button: "Back to sign in"

- If endpoint returns 4xx/5xx:
  Show generic error:
    "We couldn’t send the reset email. Please try again."
  Do NOT reveal whether email exists.

3) Reset Link Handling
- The reset flow happens via email link. When user taps it:
  - Open in the system browser using expo-web-browser (or Linking.openURL).
  - After they reset, they return to the app and sign in normally.
- Add helper text on success screen:
  "After resetting your password in the browser, return here to sign in."

4) Analytics (optional but recommended)
Add events:
- password_reset_opened
- password_reset_submitted
- password_reset_success
- password_reset_error

5) Tone Rules
- Calm and advisory tone.
- No urgency, no exclamation marks.
- Keep copy minimal and reassuring.

Implementation Notes:
- Reuse existing API client / fetch wrapper used for auth calls.
- Ensure CORS/proxy behavior matches existing auth flows in mobile.
- Add the new route to the auth stack and ensure it works on iOS/Android/Web builds.
