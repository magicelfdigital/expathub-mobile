We are refining Phase 2 (Subscription Packaging) of an Expo / React Native app.

IMPORTANT GUARDRAILS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
- Do NOT change navigation, routes, or Expo Router structure.
- Do NOT change providers, entitlements, or purchase logic.
- Do NOT add new dependencies.
- Do NOT refactor components unless explicitly requested.
- Provide FULL FILE REPLACEMENTS ONLY when changing files.
- Ask for files ONE AT A TIME.

CONTEXT (AUTHORITATIVE)
- Subscriptions are already implemented.
- EntitlementContext is the single source of truth.
- ProPaywall and ProGate already exist and work.
- Phase 1 (Data Foundation) is complete.
- Phase 2 (Subscription Packaging) is about COPY, STRUCTURE, and CLARITY — not features.

OBJECTIVE
Shift the Pro value proposition from:
“Access premium guides”
to:
“Avoid making the wrong residency decision”

People should feel they are paying for:
- disqualification clarity
- decision confidence
- avoiding costly mistakes

TASKS (IN ORDER)

TASK 1 — Rewrite Pro Offer Data (Decision Briefs)
Update `src/data/pro-offer.ts` to encode opinionated, decision-driven Pro content.

Requirements:
- Keep the existing exported function signature:
  `getProOffer(countrySlug?, pathwayKey?)`
- Keep the existing ProOffer shape:
  headline, bullets, mistakesAvoided, notFor, ctaLabel
- Do NOT require any screen changes

Implement explicit decision briefs for:
1) Spain Non-Lucrative Visa (NLV)
   - Who it is actually for
   - Who it is not for
   - Common misconceptions and rejection risks
2) Portugal D7 vs D8
   - Clear rule for choosing between them
   - Why people choose incorrectly
3) Digital Nomad Visas
   - Why people get rejected even when they meet income thresholds

Decision briefs must:
- Be opinionated
- Emphasize ruling OUT bad fits
- Focus on real-world review behavior, not blog theory

TASK 2 — Rewrite Paywall Framing (NO LOGIC CHANGES)
Update `src/components/ProPaywall.tsx` to reflect decision-first framing.

Requirements:
- Do NOT change pricing, purchase, restore, or platform logic.
- Do NOT change component props or exports.
- Rewrite copy and section ordering only.

Paywall should emphasize:
- “Make the right decision before you spend time and money”
- “See which pathways you should rule out”
- Avoidance of costly mistakes

CTA language should shift from:
“Unlock Pro”
to:
“See which pathways to rule out” (or equivalent)

OUTPUT FORMAT
1) Ask me for `src/data/pro-offer.ts`
2) Provide a FULL replacement for that file
3) Then ask me for `src/components/ProPaywall.tsx`
4) Provide a FULL replacement for that file

Do not proceed past these two files.
